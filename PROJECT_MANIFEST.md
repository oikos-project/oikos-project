# OIKOS Project Manifest

## Project Vision

OIKOS aims to be a safe and personal AI assistant, serving as a central hub for an individual's digital and physical life, fostering a harmonious balance between personal and professional spheres.

## Core Goals

1.  **Open Source Personal Assistant:** Develop a fully open-source AI assistant that prioritizes user privacy and control.

2.  **Digital Life Integration:** Seamlessly connect with and manage aspects of the user's personal digital life, including but not limited to email and calendar services.

3.  **Physical Life Integration (Home Automation):** Provide robust connectivity and control over the user's physical environment through home automation systems.

4.  **Personal and Professional Bridge:** Facilitate a balanced interaction between the user's personal and professional lives, streamlining tasks and information flow across both domains.

5.  **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Design the system to inherently support multiple users and multiple physical locations (e.g., several houses, different family members), ensuring data isolation and personalized experiences.

## Deployment Strategy

OIKOS will support two primary deployment models:

1.  **Self-Hosted:** Users will have the option to deploy and run the OIKOS project on their own infrastructure, providing maximum control over data and privacy.
2.  **Cloud Multi-Tenancy:** A cloud-hosted version will be available, designed to serve multiple users and organizations efficiently, leveraging the multi-tenancy architecture.
